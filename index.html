<p>  My name is Joseph Flores II, though I go by Joe. I am a Technical Sergeant in the United States Air Force and have been in the military for almost 12 years as<br> 
a meteorologist. I have been married for a little over 3 years to my wonderful wife Kindall and we have 2 dogs: Charlotte (6, Mutt) and Teddy (4, Tibetan Mastiff).<br> 
We just recently moved to Omaha, Nebraska since I got reassigned to do software development work for my career field, so we bought our first house together (I had <br>
one before we met), which is nice since I am mostly teleworking in my position.</p><br>

<p>  My hobbies are fairly widespread and I try to find different things to make life more enjoyable. When staying around the house, I enjoy watching anime and <br>
playing video games or playing board games and hanging out with the wife and dogs. Outside of the house, I enjoy golfing, snowboarding, and going to <br>
football/baseball games. My wife and I also enjoy going on cruises whenever possible and going to art auctions, as we have a sizable collection at this point. <br>
Below are pictures of my family.</p><br>
